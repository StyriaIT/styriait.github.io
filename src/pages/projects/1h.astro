                    The development of the 1H products for server management started as an in-house project for server management improvement 
                    by SiteGround hosting company in 2007. 
                    The aim was to address the most common problems the company experienced in the administration of its servers. 
                    The results we achieved were so impressive that we decided to expand this in-house project to an independent business venture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first product released for the use of the company was a version of the monitoring system that is now the heart of 1H Guardian. 
                    One year later the whole set of tools was already in use. Now, two years later, after all 
                    SiteGround servers have been successfully managed for a whole year with the 
                    help of our unique set of management tools, we are happy to present it to the general public.

                1H Digits allows web hosts to have one-click access to information about space and traffic usage on their servers. The detailed information helps web hosts decide what number of users can be kept on each server by identifying server users with abnormally high disk usage and periods with abnormally high network traffic.

Our data visualization system allows you to see all the important information generated from the 1H software at a glance.
