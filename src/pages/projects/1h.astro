                    The development of the 1H products for server management started as an in-house project for server management improvement 
                    by SiteGround hosting company in 2007. 
                    The aim was to address the most common problems the company experienced in the administration of its servers. 
                    The results we achieved were so impressive that we decided to expand this in-house project to an independent business venture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first product released for the use of the company was a version of the monitoring system that is now the heart of 1H Guardian. 
                    One year later the whole set of tools was already in use. Now, two years later, after all 
                    SiteGround servers have been successfully managed for a whole year with the 
                    help of our unique set of management tools, we are happy to present it to the general public.

                1H Guardian is the first server monitoring and reaction system designed specifically for the needs of web hosting providers. 
                With 1H Guardian you will not simply get notified when your server is overloaded or when a service running on your machine goes down. 
                Instead, most issues will be prevented or fixed by the tool without human intervention in less than 1 second!

            <Feature icon="mdi:protocol" title="Hawk">

                It is a highly effective intrusion detection and prevention system, specifically designed to use as little resources as possible.
